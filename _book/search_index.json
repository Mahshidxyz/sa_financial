It is mainly focussed on applying the stastical tecnquines developed in the survival field to the financial industry. The emphasis is placed in understanding the methods, building intuition about when aplying each of them and showing their application through the use of statistical software. "],
["intro.html", "Chapter 1 Introduction", " Chapter 1 Introduction You can label chapter and section titles using {#label} after them, e.g., we can reference Chapter 1. If you do not manually label them, there will be automatic labels anyway, e.g., Chapter 3. Figures and tables with captions will be placed in figure and table environments, respectively. par(mar = c(4, 4, .1, .1)) plot(pressure, type = &#39;b&#39;, pch = 19) Figure 1.1: Here is a nice figure! Reference a figure by its code chunk label with the fig: prefix, e.g., see Figure 1.1. Similarly, you can reference tables generated from knitr::kable(), e.g., see Table 1.1. knitr::kable( head(iris, 20), caption = &#39;Here is a nice table!&#39;, booktabs = TRUE ) Table 1.1: Here is a nice table!

["about-the-author.html", "About the Author", " About the Author Marta Sestelo is a PhD in Statistics and Data Scientist at the Centre of Mathematics (CMAT) of the University of Minho. She is focused on the development of new methodologies and algorithms linked with statistics. She is interested in estimation and inference methods of flexible models, in developing practical tools for data analysis and in gaining better understanding of real life issues through statistical knowledge. At the moment, her lines of research are closely related to computational statistics and machine learning, particularly, software development, feature selection, applied predictive modeling, nonparametric curves estimation, clustering, model performance, testing procedures, bootstrap resampling methods and applications to different areas of knowledge.
