This book is designed to provide a guide for a short course on survival analysis. It is mainly focussed on applying the stastical tecnquines developed in the survival field to the financial industry.

<!-- This is a _sample_ book written in **Markdown**. You can use anything that Pandoc's Markdown supports, e.g., a math equation $a^2 + b^2 = c^2$. -->

<!-- For now, you have to install the development versions of **bookdown** from Github: -->

<!-- ```{r eval=FALSE} -->
<!-- devtools::install_github("rstudio/bookdown") -->
<!-- ``` -->

<!-- Remember each Rmd file contains one and only one chapter, and a chapter is defined by the first-level heading `#`. -->

<!-- To compile this example to PDF, you need to install XeLaTeX. -->

<!-- ```{r include=FALSE} -->
<!-- # automatically create a bib database for R packages -->
<!-- knitr::write_bib(c( -->
<!--   .packages(), 'bookdown', 'knitr', 'rmarkdown' -->
<!-- ), 'packages.bib') -->
<!-- ``` -->
